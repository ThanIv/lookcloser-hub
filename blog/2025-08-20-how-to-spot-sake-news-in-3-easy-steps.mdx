We’ve all seen it—headlines that sound too wild to be true, posts that spread like wildfire, or “breaking news” that your cousin swears is real. But not everything online is trustworthy. In fact, fake news spreads faster than real news because it’s designed to grab attention.
The good news? You don’t need to be a journalist to figure out what’s real and what’s not. Here are 3 simple steps to help you spot fake news before you hit share:<!-- truncate -->

### 🧐 Step 1: Check the Source
Ask yourself: Where is this coming from?
- Is it from a well-known news outlet or a random blog you’ve never heard of?
- Does the website look suspicious (lots of ads, weird URLs, or no “About Us” page)?

👉 If the site name looks like “bbc-news-now.net” instead of “bbc.com,” it’s probably fake.

### 🔍 Step 2: Look Beyond the Headline
Headlines are often clickbait—meant to make you emotional so you’ll click.
- Read the full article, not just the headline.
- Check if the story has facts, evidence, or quotes from reliable experts.
-See if other trusted sites are reporting the same story.

👉 If only one shady site is talking about it, that’s a red flag.

### ✅ Step 3: Verify with Fact-Checking Tools
When in doubt, double-check!
- Try sites like Snopes, PolitiFact, or FactCheck.org.
- Use Google Reverse Image Search to see if a viral photo has been used out of context.
- Check the date—sometimes old news gets recycled as “breaking.”

👉 A quick 30-second check can save you from spreading misinformation.
