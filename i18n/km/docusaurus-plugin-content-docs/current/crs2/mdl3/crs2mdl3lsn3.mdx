Not every site using the image is trustworthy. To find the original, check:
- Which site posted it first
- Whether it comes from a credible outlet like Reuters, AP, or a government archive
- The image qualityâ€”originals are usually higher resolution.

Be cautious with:
- Meme sites
- Random reposts without context
