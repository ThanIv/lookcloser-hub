  "description": "We started with the basics—what reverse image search is and why it matters. Then we practiced how to use it step-by-step. We explored advanced tricks like time filters, and we saw how it helps in real-world cases: spotting fake news, scams, and misuse of images. Finally, we learned about the tool’s limitations and alternatives.",
