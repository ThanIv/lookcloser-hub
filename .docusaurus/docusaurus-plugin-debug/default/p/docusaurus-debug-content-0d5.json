But not everything online is trustworthy. In fact, fake news spreads faster than real news because it’s designed to grab attention.\r\nThe good news? You don’t need to be a journalist to figure out what’s real and what’s not. Here are 3 simple steps to help you spot fake news before you hit share:<!-- truncate -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🧐 Step 1: Check the Source\r\nAsk yourself: Where is this coming from?\r\n- Is it from a well-known news outlet or a random blog you’ve never heard of?\r\n- Does the website look suspicious (lots of ads, weird URLs, or no “About Us” page)?\r\n\r\n👉 If the site name looks like “bbc-news-now.net” instead of “bbc.com,” it’s probably fake.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🔍 Step 2: Look Beyond the Headline\r\nHeadlines are often clickbait—meant to make you emotional so you’ll click.\r\n- Read the full article, not just the headline.\r\n- Check if the story has facts, evidence, or quotes from reliable experts.\r\n-See if other trusted sites are reporting the same story.\r\n\r\n👉 If only one shady site is talking about it, that’s a red flag.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### ✅ Step 3: Verify with Fact-Checking Tools\r\nWhen in doubt, double-check!\r\n- Try sites like Snopes, PolitiFact, or FactCheck.org.\r\n- Use Google Reverse Image Search to see if a viral photo has been used out of context.\r\n- Check the date—sometimes old news gets recycled as “breaking.”\r\n\r\n👉 A quick 30-second check can save you from spreading misinformation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nFake news is everywhere, but it doesn’t have to fool you. By checking the source, reading beyond the headline, and verifying with fact-checkers, you’ll be way ahead of the curve.\r\n\r\n:::tip\r\nNext time you see a shocking post online, take a breath and test it with these 3 steps.

Sometimes we see them so often that they start to feel true. The good news? With a little media and information literacy (MIL), we can learn to question and fact-check before believing or sharing.\r\n\r\nHere are 5 common online myths—and how you can spot the truth.<!-- truncate -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🚫 Myth 1: “If it’s on the internet, it must be true.”\r\nJust because something is online doesn’t make it reliable. Anyone can publish anything with zero fact-checking.\r\n\r\n✅ **How to check:** Look at the source. Is it a trusted organization, news outlet, or expert? Or just a random blog or meme page?\r\n\r\n📌 **Facebook Example:** You see a Facebook post from a page called “XXX Health Secrets Revealed” claiming that eating garlic daily prevents all viruses. The page has no credentials or links to studies. Checking the source, you find it’s not affiliated with any medical organization. Instead, consult trusted sources like the World Health Organization or CDC for accurate health information.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🚫 Myth 2: “A lot of people are sharing it, so it must be real.”\r\nViral doesn’t equal true. Fake news spreads faster than facts because it’s designed to shock.\r\n\r\n✅ **How to check:** Search if reputable news sites are also covering the story. If it’s only circulating on social media, be cautious.\r\n\r\n📌 **Example:** A post on X goes viral claiming a celebrity died in a car crash, with thousands of shares and emotional comments. You search major news outlets like BBC or CNN but find no mention of the story. It’s only on social media, suggesting it’s likely a hoax. Wait for verified reports before believing or sharing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🚫 Myth 3: “Pictures and videos don’t lie.”\r\nThey can—and they do. Old photos, AI images, or edited videos are often recycled to trick people.\r\n\r\n✅ **How to check:** Use tools like Google Reverse Image Search or TinEye to see where the photo originally came from.\r\n\r\n📌 **Example:** A viral video shows a tsunami hitting a coastal city, shared as if it happened yesterday. Using Google Reverse Image Search on a key frame, you find the footage is from a 2011 tsunami in Japan, not a recent event. Always verify the context of images or videos before sharing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🚫 Myth 4: “Headlines tell the full story.”\r\nHeadlines are often written to grab attention (a.k.a. clickbait). The truth is usually deeper—or completely different.\r\n\r\n✅ **How to check:** Always read the full article. Look for evidence, sources, and dates before reacting.\r\n\r\n📌 **Example:** A headline screams, “New Study Proves Coffee Causes Heart Attacks!” Reading the full article reveals the study was on mice, not humans, and only showed minor effects at extreme doses. Checking the original study or reputable health sites like Mayo Clinic clarifies the claim is exaggerated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🚫 Myth 5: “If my favorite influencer/friend said it, it’s true.”\r\nEven well-meaning people can share misinformation. Trusting only personalities or friends can lead us astray.\r\n\r\n✅ **How to check:** Double-check their claims with independent fact-checkers like Snopes or FactCheck.org.\r\n\r\n📌 **Example:** Your favorite fitness influencer posts that a specific supplement burns fat in 48 hours. You check Snopes and find no scientific evidence supports this claim; the influencer was promoting a sponsored product. Cross-check claims with fact-checking sites or scientific studies to avoid being misled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### ✨ Final Thoughts\r\nWe all fall for online myths sometimes—because they’re designed to be catchy, emotional, and easy to believe. But with a few simple checks, we can stop misinformation in its tracks.\r\n\r\n:::tip\r\n\r\nPause, check, then share. The internet becomes a smarter place when we do.\r\n\r\n:::"}],"blogListPaginated":[{"items":["how-to-spot-sake-news-in-3-easy-steps","5-cool-sites-to-learn-about-media-and-information-literacy","5-common-myths-we-believe-online"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":3,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"blogTags":{"/blog/tags/mediaLiteracy":{"inline":false,"label":"MediaLiteracy","permalink":"/blog/tags/mediaLiteracy","description":"MediaLiteracy tag description","items":["how-to-spot-sake-news-in-3-easy-steps","5-cool-sites-to-learn-about-media-and-information-literacy","5-common-myths-we-believe-online"],"pages":[{"items":["how-to-spot-sake-news-in-3-easy-steps","5-cool-sites-to-learn-about-media-and-information-literacy","5-common-myths-we-believe-online"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tags/mediaLiteracy","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":3,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"unlisted":false},"/blog/tags/factChecking":{"inline":false,"label":"FactChecking","permalink":"/blog/tags/factChecking","description":"FactChecking tag description","items":["how-to-spot-sake-news-in-3-easy-steps","5-cool-sites-to-learn-about-media-and-information-literacy","5-common-myths-we-believe-online"],"pages":[{"items":["how-to-spot-sake-news-in-3-easy-steps","5-cool-sites-to-learn-about-media-and-information-literacy","5-common-myths-we-believe-online"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tags/factChecking","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":3,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"unlisted":false},"/blog/tags/onlineMyths":{"inline":false,"label":"OnlineMyths","permalink":"/blog/tags/onlineMyths","description":"OnlineMyths tag description","items":["how-to-spot-sake-news-in-3-easy-steps","5-cool-sites-to-learn-about-media-and-information-literacy","5-common-myths-we-believe-online"],"pages":[{"items":["how-to-spot-sake-news-in-3-easy-steps","5-cool-sites-to-learn-about-media-and-information-literacy","5-common-myths-we-believe-online"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tags/onlineMyths","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":3,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"unlisted":false},"/blog/tags/fakeNews":{"inline":false,"label":"FakeNews","permalink":"/blog/tags/fakeNews","description":"FakeNews tag description","items":["how-to-spot-sake-news-in-3-easy-steps","5-cool-sites-to-learn-about-media-and-information-literacy","5-common-myths-we-believe-online"],"pages":[{"items":["how-to-spot-sake-news-in-3-easy-steps","5-cool-sites-to-learn-about-media-and-information-literacy","5-common-myths-we-believe-online"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tags/fakeNews","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":3,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"unlisted":false}},"blogTagsListPath":"/blog/tags","authorsMap":{"LookCloser_Hub":{"name":"LookCloser Hub","title":"LookCloser Hub, Community","url":"https://linkedin.com/in/yangshun","key":"LookCloser_Hub","page":null}}}},"docusaurus-plugin-content-pages":{"default":[{"type":"jsx","permalink":"/","source":"@site/src/pages/index.tsx"},{"type":"mdx","permalink":"/markdown-page","source":"@site/src/pages/markdown-page.md","title":"Markdown page example","description":"You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.","frontMatter":{"title":"Markdown page example"},"unlisted":false},{"type":"jsx","permalink":"/learn-more/","source":"@site/src/pages/learn-more/index.tsx"},{"type":"jsx","permalink":"/resource/","source":"@site/src/pages/resource/index.tsx"},{"type":"jsx","permalink":"/webinar/","source":"@site/src/pages/webinar/index.tsx"}]},"docusaurus-plugin-debug":{},"docusaurus-plugin-svgr":{},"docusaurus-theme-classic":{},"docusaurus-bootstrap-plugin":{},"docusaurus-mdx-fallback-plugin":{}}}
