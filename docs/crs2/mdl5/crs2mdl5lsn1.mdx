Welcome to Module 5. We’ve learned how powerful Google Reverse Image Search is, but like all tools, it has limitations.

### Google’s Tool Isn’t Perfect
Google may not find very new or unpublished images. If someone just posted an image in a private group, it won’t show up. It also can’t tell you who edited an image, or detect every AI-generated fake. Sometimes, you’ll get lookalike images that aren’t actually connected.

- May miss new or unpublished images
- Doesn’t always reveal who edited an image
- Sometimes results show similar but unrelated images
- Limited accuracy on cropped/blurred images

### Common Challenges
Cropped or blurry versions often confuse the system. Results can also differ by country or region.

- Image appears in private groups or closed apps → won’t show up in Google
- Deepfakes or AI-generated images → harder to detect
- Regional differences: Google may show different results depending on location

Other tools can help:
- TinEye is great at tracking when an image first appeared online.
- Yandex Images often gives stronger matches for faces and landscapes.
- Bing Visual Search covers different websites than Google.
