### Step 1: Accessing It (Stored Image)

- **Desktop (PC/Laptop)**:
    - Go to [images.google.com](https://images.google.com/)
    - Click the camera icon in the search bar
    - Select Upload an image → Choose File → pick the image from your storage
- **Mobile (Phone/Tablet):**
    - Open Chrome app
    - Tap the camera icon
    - Select Upload an image → choose the photo from your gallery/storage

### Step 2: Reading the results page (visually similar images, related sites, timestamps)

Once Google processes the image, you’ll see:
- **Visually Similar Images** – other pictures that look like yours
- **Related Websites** – where the image has appeared online
- **Timestamps** – sometimes shows when it was first published
- **Best Guess / Keywords** – Google may suggest a description of the image
