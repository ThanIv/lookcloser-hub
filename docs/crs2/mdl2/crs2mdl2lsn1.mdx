### Step 1: Accessing It (Desktop vs. Mobile)

- **Desktop:**
    - Go to [images.google.com](https://images.google.com/)
    - Or right-click an image → Search image with Google Lens
- **Mobile:**
    - Open Chrome app → long press image → Search with Google Lens
    - Or use desktop mode to open [images.google.com](https://images.google.com/)

### Step 2: Uploading or pasting an image link

You can upload an image directly from your computer or phone, paste an image link from the web, or simply drag and drop the file into the Google Images search bar.
- Upload an image file from your computer/phone
- Paste a URL of an online image
- Drag & drop an image directly into the search bar

### Step 3: Reading the results page (visually similar images, related sites, timestamps)

Once Google processes the image, you’ll see:
- **Visually Similar Images** – other pictures that look like yours
- **Related Websites** – where the image has appeared online
- **Timestamps** – sometimes shows when it was first published
- **Best Guess / Keywords** – Google may suggest a description of the image
