### Case Study 1 – Shark on the Highway
This photo went viral after a hurricane, claiming sharks were swimming on highways. Reverse search shows it was actually a shark from National Geographic edited into a flood photo. Fact-checkers like Snopes confirmed it was fake.

Scammers create ads showing celebrities promoting products they never endorsed. Reverse search shows the original celebrity photo came from a magazine or stock photo, then edited with a fake product. These scams spread quickly on social media.
