Combining Keywords + Reverse Image Search
- Upload an image + add a keyword (e.g., “fire protest 2019”)
- Narrows down search results
- Helps when many similar images appear

Sometimes, uploading an image alone gives too many results. Try combining it with keywords—like uploading a wildfire photo and adding the word California. This narrows down results and gives more accurate sources.
