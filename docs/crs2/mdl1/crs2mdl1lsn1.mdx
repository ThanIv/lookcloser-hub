Welcome to Module 1. In this session, we’ll explore how reverse image search helps us verify what we see online.

### What is Reverse Image Search?
- Search the web using an image instead of text
- Google finds:
    - Where the image appears online
    - Similar images
    - Context and related info

Instead of typing words, you can use an image itself to search. Google then shows you where the image has appeared online, and sometimes even when it first appeared.

### Regular Search vs. Reverse Image Search
- Regular Search: You type words → results based on text
- Reverse Search: You upload/paste an image → results based on visuals

With a regular search, you type words like ‘red car’. With reverse search, you upload a picture of the red car, and Google finds visually similar photos or websites containing it.

### Why Images Can Mislead Online
- Old photos reused as “new”
- Edited / Photoshopped images
- Photos claimed from wrong location/event

Images spread faster than facts. Old photos can be reused, edits can change meaning, and sometimes the photo isn’t even from the place it claims to be. Reverse search helps uncover the truth.
