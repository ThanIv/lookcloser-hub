### Examples in Action
- Viral “shark on highway” image 🦈 → Edited photo

### Activity: Test Your Fact-Checking Skills with FakeOut

We often come across viral pictures or claims online. Some may be real, others misleading.
Before we trust what we see, it’s important to verify.

👉 Instead of just looking at one picture here, let’s practice in an interactive way:

- Play the [FakeOut Game](https://ctrl-f.ca/en/fakeout/)
.
- As you play, notice how the game challenges you to spot suspicious details.
- Reflect: What strategies helped you figure out what was true or false?
- How could you apply these skills the next time you see a viral post or image?
